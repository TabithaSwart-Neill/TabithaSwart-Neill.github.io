                    I am an independent disability support worker 
                    to the level of social-, admin- and domestic support.

                    My passion is to support people to pursue and accomplish 
                    their goals, and I contribute in creative ways, which in itself,
                    keeps my days interesting and I go the extra mile for my clients, 
                    just because I CARE.

                    Over the past twenty years, my main focus was to 
                    help individuals capture and digitise their life 
                    stories. This would include memories, souvenirs, 
                    accomplishments and lots more, all preserved into 
                    digital formats and then combined into a production 
                    that could be showcased and enjoyed with friends and 
                    family on special occasions.
                
                    I am currently part of the She Codes Plus program 
                    in Brisbane to develop and enhance my tech skills.
